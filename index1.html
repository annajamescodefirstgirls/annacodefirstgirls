				<p>Exeter is a small city located in Devon. Surrounded by beautiful countryside, the city offers the typical student acitives as well as a range of outdoor pursuits. There are many reasons as to why Exeter is a fantastic university. We have both loved our time at Exeter and with every year we have discovered new and exicting things. The best way to learn about your university is through word of mouth and other students. </p>
